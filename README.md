# Materialize Design Library

Material design components library I'm creating that doesn't use dependencies like JQuery. There are many libraries like materialcss that make use of the design theory but I wanted a set of compoents that are light weight and have a small footprint. The reason is for small webapps which don't need the complete power of libraries like bootstrap.
